#Room title – Deck 2, CIC

##Room Description(s) – 
This floor is very large. From where you start, to your south there is the bridge walkway, leading to the bridge.
 In front of you, you can see the galaxy map, and slight left of that we have the tech lab, slightly to the right of the galaxy map you see the armoury.
 Directly in front of the galaxy map, is the elevator.
] There are various items scattered around this floor that you will need to explore to find.
In the tech lab, we have many useful items to find, and an access ladder down to Deck 3. 
Alternatively, you can continue to explore and potentially find other routes to escape.
The armoury houses lots of secrets for the player to explore him/herself.

#Room title – Deck 3 Crew’s Quarters

##Room Description(s) – 
The Crew’s quarters, are where the crew spend their free time. 
As you exit the elevator, in front of you, there is a wall, and a path. 
To the far left of the path, we have the port observation deck, where the crew can look out onto the stars as the Normandy travels at FTL speeds. 
On the right of the path, we have the Starboard observation deck, which serves the same purpose. 
On the wall, there are two doors. One leads to the crew’s living space, where there are various tables, TVs and beds for different activities. 
Through the other door, we have the life support room. This room is very damp, and not very loud. It has a window which looks out onto the engine core – which is accessible on the next floor.
 As you follow the walkway around the curve [see map], you will encounter the Mess Hall.
 In the mess hall, there is the kitchen, where various utilities and food can be found. 
There is one centre table, for the crew to eat on, and finally various other paths to access other areas of the third deck.
 To the right of the mess hall, we have a Medical Bay, where various stimulation packs can be found in order to make yourself feel better – if injured. To the right of the Mess Hall, we have the First Officer’s room. 
This area is usually restricted, but in case of emergencies – like this, every room opens up. 
Directly in front of the mess hall are escape pods along a pathway, these can only be accessed with a passphrase, usually kept on a piece of paper on the engineering deck!
 Further along this path, you will reach a door that takes you to the Main Battery (mind the spelling error on the map). The main battery doesn’t serve much purpose – although it may be worth exploring, to discover any Easter Eggs, or any other secrets!

#Room title – Deck 4 – Engineers deck

##Room Description(s) – 
As you leave the elevator, you are greeted with a wall, and a path – similar to the previous deck. 
Except, this time the doors are on either side of the elevator. The doors both lead to the same room. 
On either end of the path, are port and starboard cargo decks. The cargo, however, has been released out of the airlock as part of the emergency escape protocol, 
So looking in there isn’t necessary.
 If you go through the doors either side of the elevator, than you are taken into the walkway leading to the engine core. 
This walkway has various terminals/computers where the engineers of the ship maintain the main processes of the ship. 
Oh no!
 Through the right door, you see the corpse of an Engineer! 
You can choose to search his body for any potential information.
If you choose to continue forward into the engine core, you may try and override the engine core terminal, to try and slow down the ships crash course, and increase the time on the timer.
