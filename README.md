[The Game Plan](plan.md)

To install the game:

* Remember to unzip the folder

* Run the game using game.py and no other python files

* Get the latest version from github almost daily if change has been made

since most changes cause need for more files.

If you do not want to constantly carry the game :

*John O'Sullivan has an available copy on his hard drive for all users.

*During C7 lunch, completed files can be given to micro SD files.
